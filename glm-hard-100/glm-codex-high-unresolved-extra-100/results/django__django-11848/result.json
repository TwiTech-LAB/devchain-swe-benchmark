      "content": "## Fix Summary\n\nFixed `django.utils.http.parse_http_date` to comply with RFC 7231 for two-digit year interpretation. The previous implementation used hardcoded ranges (0-69 \u2192 2000-2069, 70-99 \u2192 1970-1999). The new implementation dynamically interprets two-digit years relative to the current year with a 50-year threshold, as required by RFC 7231:\n\n> \"Recipients of a timestamp value in rfc850-date format, which uses a two-digit year, MUST interpret a timestamp that appears to be more than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\"\n\n## Files Modified\n- `django/utils/http.py`: Replaced hardcoded year mapping logic with RFC 7231 compliant algorithm\n\n## Test Results\n- **Test file:** tests/utils_tests/test_http.HttpDateProcessingTests\n- **Baseline (before fix):** 5 passed\n- **After fix:** 5 passed\n- **Regression check:** No new failures introduced\n- **Pre-existing errors:** None in the HttpDateProcessingTests class\n\n## Additional Verification\nVerified RFC 7231 compliance with current year 2026:\n- Years 00-76 \u2192 2000-2076 (within 50 years from now)\n- Years 77-99 \u2192 1977-1999 (more than 50 years in the future \u2192 previous century)\n\nExample: \"Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT\" correctly maps to 1994 (not 2094) because 2094 would be 68 years in the future, exceeding the 50-year threshold.\n\n## Concerns\n- None. The fix is minimal, focused, and correctly implements RFC 7231 requirements.",
