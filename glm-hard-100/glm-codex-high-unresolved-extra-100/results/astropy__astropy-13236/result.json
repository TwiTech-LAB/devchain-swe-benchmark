      "content": "## Fix Summary\nAdded a `FutureWarning` when a structured numpy array is passed directly to a Table. The warning tells users to wrap the data in `Column` explicitly to avoid the warning.\n\n## Files Modified\n- `astropy/table/table.py`: Added `warnings.warn()` call with `FutureWarning` before converting structured ndarray to `NdarrayMixin`\n\n## Test Results\n- **Test file:** `/testbed/astropy/table/tests/test_table.py`\n- **Baseline (before fix):** 458 passed, 1 failed, 19 skipped, 1 xfailed\n- **After fix:** 458 passed, 1 failed, 19 skipped, 1 xfailed\n- **Regression check:** No new failures introduced (the 1 failed test `test_values_equal_part1` is pre-existing)\n\n## Additional Verification\n1. Verified that passing a structured ndarray directly to Table triggers the `FutureWarning`\n2. Verified that wrapping the structured ndarray in `Column` explicitly does NOT trigger the warning\n\n## Concerns\n- None. The change is minimal and focused on adding the deprecation warning as requested.",
